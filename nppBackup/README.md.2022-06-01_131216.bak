WADE-TROSY Pulse sequence in Bruker format is 'wadetrosy_v5_3.mpp'. The RF shapes are listed below 

| Shape Name| Operation Type  | Nuclei | Pulse Length factor | Pulse Length | Max RF amplitude | Bandwidth |
| -------------   | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| wade_pix_25.900p1_bw1.75B1.mrf   | WADE-π    | 1H 	| 25.9| 25.9*50us = 1295us	| 5 kHz	| 1.75*B1  |
| wade_pix_37.250p1_bw2.82B1.mrf   | WADE-π    | 1H 	| 37.25| 37.25*50us = 1862.5us	| 5 kHz	| 2.82*B1 |
| wade_pix_47.200p1_bw3.85B1.mrf   | WADE-π    | 1H 	| 47.2| 47.2*50us = 2360us	| 5 kHz	| 3.85*B1 |
| pix_7.984p1_bw0.70B1.mrf   | Amide π    | 1H 	| 7.984| 7.984*10us = 79.84us	| 25 kHz	| 0.7*B1 

 

Water selectivity and bandwidth can be tuned by changing the RF power, the correponding pulse length is calculated by multiplying the 90 degree pulse length with the pulse length factor for each pulse. 

consider the 'wade_pix_25.900p1_bw1.75B1.mrf' shape,

for RF amplitude 25kHz (=> 90 pulse length = 10us), pulse length = 25.9*10us = 259 us 

for RF amplitude 5kHz (=> 90 pulse length = 50us), pulse length = 25.9*50us = 1295us
