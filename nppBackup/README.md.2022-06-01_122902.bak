1 : 'wade_pix_25.900p1_bw1.75B1.mrf' 

    Pulse length 25.9 times the 90 deg pulse length
    For 5kHz RF amplitude (i.e., p1 = 50us), pulse length = 25.9*50us = 1295us


2 : 'wade_pix_37.250p1_bw2.82B1.mrf'

    Pulse length 37.25 times the 90 deg pulse length
    For 5kHz RF amplitude (i.e., p1 = 50us), pulse length = 37.25*50us = 1862.5us


3 : 'wade_pix_47.200p1_bw3.85B1.mrf'

    Pulse length 47.2 times the 90 deg pulse length
    For 5kHz RF amplitude (i.e., p1 = 50us), pulse length = 47.2*50us = 2360us
